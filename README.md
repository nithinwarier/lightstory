# lightstory

Light story is an android native app written purely in kotlin. Some of the features of it are,

1) Through the app, user can take a picture through camera
2) This picture will be available for 24 hours. After that it will reset, similar like the stories in whatsapp, but a much lighter version. 
3) No data syncing here, all the data saved locally.
4) Every minute the screen will refresh by itself and update the timestamp using kotlin coroutines.
